# TiKit UI Components - Let's See It in Action! ðŸ‘‹

Curious what **TiKit UI Components** actually look like when you put them to work? You're in exactly the right spot!

This isn't just a stuffy demo - it's a full-blown cross-platform [**Titanium SDK**](https://titaniumsdk.com) app for iOS & Android, lovingly crafted with [**PurgeTSS**](https://purgetss.com) and showcasing everything our [**TiKit UI**](https://purgetss.com/tikit/) library has to offer.

We built everything you see with **TiKit Components**, so you can get a real feel for how they work. To keep things straightforward, most of the content (text, images, etc.) lives right in the `alloy.js` file. In your real-world apps, you'd probably connect these components to actual data from Alloy/Backbone Collections or your favorite APIs.

## Jump Right In ðŸš€

Ready to play with it? Here's the quick version:

1. **Got the basics?** Make sure [Titanium SDK](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) are already set up on your machine.

2. **Grab PurgeTSS:** If you haven't already, snag the PurgeTSS command-line tool:
   ```bash
   npm install -g purgetss
   ```

3. **Download the code:** Clone this repo to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url> # Just swap in the actual URL here
   cd <repository_directory> # Jump into the project folder
   ```

4. **Get dependencies** (if package.json lists any):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Fire it up:** Use Titanium's CLI to launch the app on your favorite device:
   ```bash
   # For iPhone fans:
   ti build -p ios -T simulator

   # For the Android crowd:
   ti build -p android -T device
   ```
