# TiKit UI Components Demo App

This [**Titanium App**](https://titaniumsdk.com) is a cross-platform mobile application for iOS and Android that was created using [**PurgeTSS**](https://purgetss.com) and showcases the free components available in [**TiKit UI**](https://purgetss.com/tikit/).

The entire app is built using **TiKit Components**, and the content is hard-coded in global variables in `alloy.js`. However, you can use Alloy or Backbone Collections to bind data from APIs, allowing you to dynamically populate your apps with data from external sources.

## Installation

First, make sure you have **PurgeTSS** installed globally on your machine:
```bash
> npm i -g purgetss
```

Then, download the App and run it on your device, or simulator.

## Content
The App contains the following components:

### Alerts
